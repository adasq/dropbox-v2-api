This call starts a new upload session with the given data. You can then use :route:`upload_session/append:2` to add more data and :route:`upload_session/finish` to save all the data to a file in Dropbox.\nA single request should not upload more than 150 MB. The maximum size of a file one can upload to an upload session is 350 GB.\nAn upload session can be used for a maximum of 7 days. Attempting to use an :field:`UploadSessionStartResult.session_id` with :route:`upload_session/append:2` or :route:`upload_session/finish` more than 7 days after its creation will return a :field:`UploadSessionLookupError.not_found`.\nCalls to this endpoint will count as data transport calls for any Dropbox Business teams with a limit on the number of data transport calls allowed per month. For more information, see the :link:`Data transport limit page https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/data-transport-limit`.\nBy default, upload sessions require you to send content of the file in sequential order via consecutive :route:`upload_session/start`, :route:`upload_session/append:2`, :route:`upload_session/finish` calls. For better performance, you can instead optionally use a :field:`UploadSessionType.concurrent` upload session. To start a new concurrent session, set :field:`UploadSessionStartArg.session_type` to :field:`UploadSessionType.concurrent`. After that, you can send file data in concurrent :route:`upload_session/append:2` requests. Finally finish the session with :route:`upload_session/finish`.\nThere are couple of constraints with concurrent sessions to make them work. You can not send data with :route:`upload_session/start` or :route:`upload_session/finish` call, only with :route:`upload_session/append:2` call. Also data uploaded in :route:`upload_session/append:2` call must be multiple of 4194304 bytes (except for last :route:`upload_session/append:2` with :field:`UploadSessionStartArg.close` to :val:`true`, that may contain any remaining data).","UploadSessionStartArg","session_type","UploadSessionType","sequential","Pieces of data are uploaded sequentially one after another.
