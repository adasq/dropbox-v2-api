For better performance, you can instead optionally use a :field:`UploadSessionType.concurrent` upload session.

You can not send data with :route:`upload_session/start` or :route:`upload_session/finish` call, only with :route:`upload_session/append:2` call. Also data uploaded in :route:`upload_session/append:2` call must be multiple of 4194304 bytes (except for last :route:`upload_session/append:2` with :field:`UploadSessionStartArg.close` to :val:`true`, that may contain any remaining data).","UploadSessionStartArg","session_type","UploadSessionType","sequential","Pieces of data are uploaded sequentially one after another.
