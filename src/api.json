Additionally, these errors are surfaced as generic HTTP 409 Conflict responses, potentially hiding issue details. The maximum temporary upload link duration is 4 hours.

Multiple links may exist for a specific upload path at any given time.\n\nThe POST request on the temporary upload link must have its Content-Type set to \"application/octet-stream\".\n\nExample temporary upload link consumption request:\n\ncurl -X POST https://content.dropboxapi.com/apitul/1/bNi2uIYF51cVBND\n--header \"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\"\n--data-binary @local_file.txt\n\nA successful temporary upload link consumption request returns the content hash of the uploaded data in JSON format.\n\nExample successful temporary upload link consumption response:\n{\"content-hash\": \"599d71033d700ac892a0e48fa61b125d2f5994\"}\n\nAn unsuccessful temporary upload link consumption request returns any of the following status codes:\n\nHTTP 400 Bad Request: Content-Type is not one of application/octet-stream and text/plain or request is invalid.\nHTTP 409 Conflict: The temporary upload link does not exist or is currently unavailable, the upload failed, or another error happened.\nHTTP 410 Gone: The temporary upload link is expired or consumed.\n\nExample unsuccessful temporary upload link consumption response:\nTemporary upload link has been recently consumed.","GetTemporaryUploadLinkArg","commit_info","CommitInfo","Path in the user's Dropbox to save the file.","o|2i|5t|If|bL","WriteMode","add","Do not overwrite an existing file if there is a conflict.
